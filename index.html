      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are the two major milestones in the history of the Web.</p>

      <p>The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.</p>

        <p>The first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass,_Inc." target="_blank">Spyglass</a> as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass delivered two versions to Microsoftâ€”one based on NCSA code, the other from scratch. IE was based on the latter.</p>
        <p>IE8, released in 2009, improved standards support and passed the Acid2 test. It also introduced features like WebSlices and phishing protection.</p>

        <p>Firefox began as an experimental Mozilla project called m/b. Public test builds launched in 2002 under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(web_browser)" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>. Later renamed Firefox, it quickly gained popularity.</p>
        <p>Firefox 23 introduced a new logo, HTML5 enhancements, and security updates like mixed content blocking and a new network monitor.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>'s Eric Schmidt originally opposed building Chrome. After a successful prototype from Mozilla veterans, he changed his mind.</p>
        <p>In 2010, Google introduced an MSI installer for enterprise users. Though limited in customization, it marked Google's shift toward broader business adoption.</p>
