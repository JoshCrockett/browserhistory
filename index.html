        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are the two major milestones in the history of the Web.</p>

        <p>The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.</p>

            <h2>A brief history of IE</h2>
            <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Internet_Explorer_10%2B11_logo.svg" width="100" alt="Internet Explorer Logo" class="logo"> The first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass,_Inc." target="_blank">Spyglass</a> as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code.</p>
            <p>In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8 offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully pass the Acid2 test.</p>

            <h2>A brief history of Firefox</h2>
            <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Firefox_logo%2C_2019.svg" width="100" alt="Firefox Logo" class="logo"> The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(web_browser)" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>.</p>
            <p>Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking, HTML5 support improvements, and new developer tools like a global console and network monitor.</p>

But after seeing an internal demo, he approved it. Chrome’s first release showed off its speed and simplicity.</p>
            <p>In 2010, Google introduced a Chrome MSI installer for business use, though many found its MSI wrapper limited. The move signaled Google’s increasing push into enterprise environments.</p>
